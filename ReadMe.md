### Hi there

I'm a M365 solutions consultant at Intelogy based in London UK and has been working with SharePoint (my first love!) in Europe & Australasia for well over a decade. Now working over the whole stack of M365 and Azure. I enjoy seeing in the workplace how technology can drive improvement and efficiency.

I specialise in helping clients match the best tool for the job from the Microsoft technological Swiss army knife. I work with Microsoft 365 with a big focus of SharePoint (document management, migrations, provisioning, automation, administration, Syntex), Teams, PowerShell (second love!), Power Platform and the Viva employee experience platform.

Iâ€™m passionate about learning and sharing knowledge with others. I enjoy contributing to the [PnP (Patterns & Practices)](https://pnp.github.io/) community especially [PnP PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/).
